## Beta Releases

Config migrations are only applied to major version updates. You therefore can experience issues while loading configs,
if you use a beta version.

## Note
Before beta-version 5 most of the features did not work, cause of a bug. <br>
Before beta-version 8 you are required to use the Profile tablist widget to work. <br>
##### Just use the latest available beta or stable version to have the best experience possible.

A stable version will release, when all the planned features listed above are implemented.

### Other

⚠️ The development version is always the latest stable release of Minecraft.
Therefore, new features will only be available for the current and following Minecraft versions.
